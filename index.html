<h1>Hello, I'm TJ</h1>

<p>I'm a Service Designer from the UK living in Australia. I work in Digital Transformation for Governments, where I design digital services. This means I design for every interaction from the start to the finish of a service, with an understanding of the technology that makes a service work.</p>

<p>My own website really isn't important right now, so this page is a showcase of the things I'm currently coding.</p>
